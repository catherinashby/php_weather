# php_weather

Requirements:
For this challenge, you are asked to create an index.php script that renders a web page.
The script should render a minimal web page that displays the current weather conditions
in Philadelphia, PA. You are asked to use the Weather Underground API as your data source.
Upon loading of the page, please connect to the API to get the conditions and display them
to the page as an HTML table. In addition, please include (print on the web page)
a SQL INSERT statement that would store the temperature and humidity into a SQL database
along with the timestamp. For simplicity, you may use fictitious table and field names.
